# SliDetect - Predicting LandSlide Risk Using CNN

## Project Summary:
Our project, SliDetect, integrates a covolutional neural network that evaluates landslide risk based on satellite images of different environmental factors through NASA WorldView.  This neural network was training using a data set that correlates certain environmental factors with past occurrences of landslides. To make it accessible, the neural network is integrated into a user-friendly website where the local communities can easily access it and indicate their region. Then, the algorithm will pull the data automatically from NASA open sources and generate a map of their local region with predicted landslides. If applied, this project will a revolutionary method to prevent local destruction caused by landslides.
